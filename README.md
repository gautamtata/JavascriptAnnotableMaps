Added are Two files: jquery.vmap.js and jQueryVectorMap.js

Jquery.VectorMap.js is responsible for the structural design of the map. It annotates nodes as *paths* from an .SVG file and gives a vecotor map which is annotatable using JS.

jquery.vmap.js is responsible for events on the map such as Zoom, highlighting, colors and Click events such as mouseOver and click. The default params function which gives basic instructions for map events is implemented with changes such as name of map and path names as defined in jQueryVectorMap.js
